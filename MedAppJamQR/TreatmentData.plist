			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>External Beam Radiation</string>
			<key>Information</key>
			<string>External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) focuses radiation from outside the body on the cancer. This is the type of radiation therapy most often used to treat a primary lung cancer or its spread to other organs. There are several types of external beam radiation including: Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy(3D-CRT), Intensity Modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Skin irritation, hair loss in the area that receives the radiaiton therapy, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and inflammation of the esophagus.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>Most often, radiation treatments to the lungs are given 5 days a week for 5 to 7 weeks, but this can vary based on the type of EBRT and the reason it’s being given.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Internal Beam Radiation (Brachytherapy)</string>
			<key>Information</key>
			<string>For this type of treatment, the doctor places a small source of radioactive material (often in the form of small pellets) directly into the cancer or into the airway next to the cancer. This is usually done through a bronchoscope, but it may also be done during surgery. The radiation travels only a short distance from the source, limiting the effects on surrounding healthy tissues. The radiation source is usually removed after a short time. Less often, small radioactive “seeds” are left in place permanently, and the radiation gets weaker over several weeks.</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Occasionally patients complain of short periods of nausea and fatigue, but otherwise few side-effects.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>Depending on the type of implant that is placed, therapy could last a few minutes or a few days. High-dose-rate brachy therapy only required a few minutes per session.Sessions are generally repeated throughout the day or weeks following.</string>

		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Carboplatin</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Carboplatin is an alkylating agent that works in three ways: 1. It attaches special molecules called alkyl groups onto DNA, which damages the DNA and does not allow the cell to multiply anymore. 2. Carboplatin bridges two strands of DNA together, which does not allow them to separate or allow the cell to divide and multiply. 3. Carboplatin causes errors to be made when the cancer cell is replicating. All three of these things cause the cancer cell to die.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment.</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Neutropenia or a drop in white blood cells that can predispose a patient to infection. Tiredness and breathlessness due to low blood cells, also known as anemia. Easy bruising due to low platelets. Kidney damage. Loss of fertility or loss of periods in women. Nausea. Vomiting.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Cisplatin</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Cisplatin is a drug that binds to the DNA in rapidly dividing cells and creates a bridge between portions of the DNA that does not allow further multiplycation of the cells. This effectively breaks the cell and causes it to die. The small part of the DNA that is bound is a DNA base called Guanine.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment.</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Damage to the kidneys, damage to nerves, nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, electrolyte disturbance, bone marrow suppression, and hemolytic anemia.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Docetaxel (Taxotere)</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Docetaxel is a chemotherapy drug that prevents cells from making a crane-like structure, called the mitotic spindle, that is necessary to pull cells apart during replication. If cancer cells cannot separate from one cell into two cells, cell division is stopped and the cell dies.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment. Administered every 3 weeks during the cycles.</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Low white blood cells predisposing to infection, anemia, low platelet levels, fevers, hair loss, and liver dysfunction.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Doxorubicin</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Doxorubin is a chemotherapy drug that causes DNA to break by intercalation. Basically, another normally acting ezyme breaks the cancer cell DNA to unwind it and prepare it for replication, however, at this point Doxorubicin interupts the unwinding by placing itself between the tangled strands of DNA. Since the DNA has been blocked from resealing itself after untangling, the cell cannot continue to replicate and dies.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment.</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Turns urine red/orange - this is not harmful to the patient, low WBC levels that can predispose the patient to infection, causes sores on the mouth and lips, low platelt counts, and can injure the heart muscle causing congestive heart failure during or after treatment.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Etoposide</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Etoposide is a type of chemotherapy drug that blocks a protein called topoisomerase II that keeps the DNA inside the cells from tangling and breaking. Without this enzyme, the DNA tangles up on itself and breaks causing the cell to die. Cancers rely on topoisomerase more than regular cells because they multiply more than regular cells.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment. </string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Kidney damage, damage to a fetus during pregnancy or damage to a baby if breastfeeding during treatment, and infertility.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Gemcitabine</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks an enzyme called thymidylate synthetase. Thymidylate synthetase is required for DNA in cancer cells to continue to replicate. Without this enzyme the cell stops relicating and dies.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>Usually a 4-week schedule, 1000 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle: 3-week schedule; 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle.</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Flu-like symptoms, fever (within 6-12 hours after the first dose), fatigue, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, skin rash, weakness, hair loss, mouth sores, difficulty sleeping, and shortness of breath.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Paclitaxel (Taxol)</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug that acts on infrastructure within the cancer cells and causes the cells to become stuck while trying to divide. The reason these cells become stuck is because Paclitaxel prevents the mitotic spindle, an important player in cell separation, from breaking down. At this point, cells will stop dividing and die.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment. </string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Low white blood cell levels predisposing to infection, low platelet levels causing easy bleeding and bruising, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, pain, weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, and liver damage.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Pemetrexed (Alimta)</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Pemetrexed is a chemotherapy drug that inhibits three enzymes: thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. These enzymes are required to make the building blocks of DNA. Without these enzymes, cancer cells do not have enough building blocks to make a whole DNA sequence and since replication is not possible without DNA, the cancer cells die.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment. </string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Low white blood cell levels predisposing to infection, low red blood cell counts, anemia, mental fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, oral sores, loss of appetite, rash, and constipation.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Vinorelbine</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Vinorelbine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the portion of the cancer cell that initiates division and multiplycation. This part of the cell is called the mitotic spindle. Without a functional mitotic spindle, the cell cannot be pulled apart and dies.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment.</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Peripheral neuropathy that generally begins in the hands and feet, decreased resistance to infection, easy bleeding or bruising due to anemia, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, feelings of fatigue and weakness, and on occasion inflammation and pain in the vein where the drug is administered. </string>

			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>ALK</string>
			<key>Information</key>
			<string>Some lung cancers have changes in the ALK gene that cause the cancer cell to make a protein that leads to out of control growth. Tumor tissues can be tested for this gene change.

			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Complete Blood Count (CBC)</string>
			<key>Information</key>
			<string>A CBC is a panel of tests that evaluates the three types of cells that circulate in the blood and includes the following:

Evaluation of white blood cells, the cells that are part of the body&apos;s defense system against infections and cancer and also play a role in allergies and inflammation:
White blood cell (WBC) count is a count of the total number of white blood cells in a person&apos;s sample of blood.
White blood cell differential may or may not be included as part of the panel of tests. It identifies and counts the number of the various types of white blood cells present. The five types include neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.
Evaluation of red blood cells, the cells that transport oxygen throughout the body:
Red blood cell (RBC) count is a count of the actual number of red blood cells in a person&apos;s sample of blood.
Hemoglobin measures the amount of the oxygen-carrying protein in the blood.
Hematocrit measures the percentage of a person&apos;s blood that consists of red blood cells.
Red blood cell indices are calculations that provide information on the physical characteristics of the RBCs:
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measurement of the average size of RBCs.
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) is a calculation of the average amount of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin inside a red blood cell.
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is a calculation of the average percentage of hemoglobin inside a red cell.
Red cell distribution width (RDW), which may be included in a CBC, is a calculation of the variation in the size of RBCs.
The CBC may also include reticulocyte count, which is a measurement of the absolute count or percentage of young red blood cells in blood.
Evaluation of platelets, cell fragments that are vital for normal blood clotting:
The platelet count is the number of platelets in a person&apos;s sample of blood.
Mean platelet volume (MPV) may be reported with a CBC. It is a calculation of the average size of platelets.
Platelet distribution width (PDW) may also be reported with a CBC. It is a measurement of the variation of platelet size.</string>

			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)</string>
			<key>Information</key>
			<string>The Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) is a frequently ordered panel of 14 tests that provides important information about the current status of a person&apos;s kidneys and liver, electrolyte and acid/base balance as well as levels of blood glucose and blood proteins. The CMP includes the following tests:

Glucose - Energy source for the body; a steady supply must be available for use, and a relatively constant level of glucose must be maintained in the blood.
Calcium - One of the most important minerals in the body; essential for the proper functioning of muscles, nerves, and the heart and is required in blood clotting and in the formation of bones
Proteins

Albumin - A small protein produced in the liver; the major protein in serum
Total Protein - Measures albumin as well as all other proteins in serum
Electrolytes

Sodium - Vital to normal body processes, including nerve and muscle function
Potassium - Vital to cell metabolism and muscle function
CO2 (carbon dioxide, bicarbonate) - Helps to maintain the body&apos;s acid-base balance (pH)
Chloride - Helps to regulate the amount of fluid in the body and maintain the acid-base balance
Kidney Tests

BUN (blood urea nitrogen) - Waste product filtered out of the blood by the kidneys; conditions that affect the kidney have the potential to affect the amount of urea in the blood.
Creatinine - Waste product produced in the muscles; filtered out of the blood by the kidneys so blood levels are a good indication of how well the kidneys are working
Liver Tests

ALP (alkaline phosphatase) - Enzyme found in the liver and other tissues, bone; elevated levels of ALP in the blood are most commonly caused by liver disease or bone disorders.
ALT (alanine amino transferase, also called SGPT) - Enzyme found mostly in the cells of the liver and kidney; a useful test for detecting liver damage
AST (aspartate amino transferase, also called SGOT) - Enzyme found especially in cells in the heart and liver; also a useful test for detecting liver damage
Bilirubin - Waste product produced by the liver as it breaks down and recycles aged red blood cell</string>

			<string>This protein, also known as HER1, is a receptor found on cells that helps them grow. Tests done on a piece of the cancer tissue can look for increased amounts of these receptors, which is a sign that the cancer may grow fast, spread quickly, and be harder to treat. Patients with elevated EGFR may have poorer outcomes and need more aggressive treatment, particularly with drugs that block (or inhibit) the EGFR receptors. EGFR may be used to guide treatment and predict outcomes of non-small cell lung, head and neck, colon, pancreas, or breast cancers. The results are reported as a percentage based on the number of cells tested. Some lung cancers have certain defects (mutations) in the EGFR gene that make it more likely that certain drugs will work against the cancer. These gene changes are more common in lung cancer patients who are women, non-smokers, or Asian.</string>

			<key>Preparation</key>
			<string>The night before surgery, your doctor will recommend that you “fast” – that is, not eat or drink anything (even water) for at least 8 hours.  On the morning of your surgery, a nurse will ask you several questions and place an IV (intravenous line) in your arm. She will also fit you with monitors so that your blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen levels can be monitored throughout surgery. Your surgeon will visit to again discuss the procedure and ask you to sign a consent form. The anesthesiologist will also visit to talk about the anesthesia you will be given, and ask about any problems you or your family members have experienced with anesthesia in the past.

			<key>Recovery</key>
			<string>If the procedure is done through a large incision in the chest called a thoracotomy, patients generally require 5 to 7 days in the hospital after surgery. Addiitionally, patients can experience pain for 1-2 months following the procedure. If the procedure is completed using video-assisted thoracic surgery, VATS, small incisions are made where a camera and tools can be inserted. This procedure usually requires a 4 to 5 day hospital stay with significantly less pain post-operatively in most patients. VATs procedures are used for early stage tumors near the outside of the lung.</string>

			<string>A lung needle biopsy is a procedure where the doctor uses a needle to take a small amount of tissue from a mass seen on imaging studies. During the procedure, the patient is awake but has been numbed with locally-acting medication in the area where the biospy needle will enter. Samples that are recovered from the biopsy are evaluated for cancer by a pathologist. This procedure typically lasts 30 to 60 minutes. </string>
			<key>Preparation</key>
			<string>The night before surgery, your doctor will recommend that you “fast” – that is, not eat or drink anything (even water) for at least 8 hours.  On the morning of your surgery, a nurse will ask you several questions and place an IV (intravenous line) in your arm. She will also fit you with monitors so that your blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen levels can be monitored throughout surgery. Your surgeon will visit to again discuss the procedure and ask you to sign a consent form. The anesthesiologist will also visit to talk about the anesthesia you will be given, and ask about any problems you or your family members have experienced with anesthesia in the past. The operating room staff will guide your family to a waiting area, where the surgical staff can keep them updated on your progress and speak with them when your surgery is done.</string>
			<key>Recovery</key>
			<string>None. Generally after recovering from anesthesia, patients require little to no recovery time.</string>

			<string>Lymphadenectomy</string>
			<key>Information</key>
			<string>A lymphadenectomy is a surgery done to remove cancerous lymph nodes or to accurately stage a cancer. Most commonly the mediastinal lymph nodes are removed and then evaluated by a pathologist using special microscopic techniques to look for cancer.</string>

			<string>Pneumonectomy</string>
			<key>Information</key>
			<string>With a standard pneumonectomy, either the right lung (which contains 3 lobes) or the left lung (containing 2 lobes) is removed.  A pneumonectomy is most commonly done as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, when a less invasive procedure, such as a lobectomy, cannot remove the entire tumor. This may occur if the tumor is large, if it has spread beyond a single lobe, or if it is located in the central area of the lungs.  Because a pneumonectomy involves the removal of an entire lung, the procedure is usually reserved for those people who have adequate lung function and will be able to tolerate living with only one lung. That said, many people have gone on to live active lives following a pneumonectomy.</string>

			<key>Recovery</key>
			<string>When your surgery is complete, you will be taken to the recovery room where you will monitored closely for several hours. In some cases, you may be taken directly to the intensive care unit (ICU). Following recovery, most people spend the first several days in the ICU. For the first day, your breathing may be assisted with a ventilator. Since this can cause some anxiety, you will be given medications that keep you very drowsy until the tube is removed.  When the ventilator is removed and you become less sleepy, a respiratory therapist will ask you to cough, and will assist you in the use of an incentive spirometer. This is a device that you breathe into in order to exercise your lungs, and to help keep the small air sacs in your lungs open.  When you are able, the nursing staff will help you sit, and then encourage you to get up and walk with assistance. You may not feel like being active, but increasing your activity will help you regain your strength more quickly, and reduces the risk of developing blood clots. Most people spend at least 6 to 10 days in the hospital following surgery.  Some people return to work after 8 weeks, but your doctor will give you special restrictions, such as avoiding any heavy lifting. It will also take time for your remaining lung to take over, and shortness of breath may persist for several months following surgery.</string>

			<string>Segmentectomy</string>
			<key>Information</key>
			<string>A segmentectomy involves removal of a small area of the lung along the veins, arteries, or airways. This procedure is performed when the cancer is diagnosed early and is only in a very small area.</string>
